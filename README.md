# DSA: Linked List

This program is written in C and creates a linked list based on user input. It then prints out the elements of the linked list.

#### Note: You can also access the list using the head variable assighed to the head node in the main function.

## Description

The program consists of the following components:

1. **Node Structure**: Defines the structure of a node in the linked list, which includes the data part (data) and a pointer (next) to the next node.
2. **Create Function**: Creates the linked list by taking user input and dynamically allocating memory for each node.
3. **Counter Function**: Counts the number of elements in the linked list.
4. **List Created Function**: Prints out the elements of the linked list in the form of an array.

## Usage

To use the program:

1. Compile the source code using a C compiler (e.g., GCC).
2. Run the compiled executable.
3. Follow the prompts to enter data for each node of the linked list.
4. Enter a non-integer character when done entering data.
5. The program will display the number of elements in the linked list and print out the elements.

## Example

Here's a simple example of how to use the program:

```c
// Compile the source code
gcc linkedlist.c -o linkedlist

// Run the compiled executable
./linkedlist
